To solve the problem and create a functional, visually appealing data dashboard for the American Retriever Foundation (ARF), a professional data scientist/analyst would follow these steps:

Step 1: Understand the Requirements
	•	Key Metrics to Monitor:
	1.	Number of donations.
	2.	Total dollar value of donations.
	3.	Number of legacy donors and new donors solicited.
	4.	Success rate of solicitations (number of solicitations that resulted in donations).
	5.	Comparisons by:
	•	Development officer (Randall Shalley, Donna Sanchez, Marie Lydon, Hoa Nguyen).
	•	Mode of contact (telephone, email, or personal meeting).
	•	Time (month, date).
	•	Features for the Dashboard:
	•	KPIs for donations and solicitations.
	•	Drill-down functionality (e.g., filters for date, development officer, and contact mode).
	•	Clear and consistent formatting with professional aesthetics.

Step 2: Data Exploration and Cleaning
	•	Load the Data: Examine the structure, data types, and null values in the provided dataset (ProspectData.xlsx).
	•	Data Validation:
	•	Check if all necessary fields (e.g., donation amounts, solicitation results, legacy donor status) are present and correctly formatted.
	•	Validate consistency in the mode of contact and development officer names.
	•	Data Cleaning:
	•	Handle missing or inconsistent values.
	•	Ensure date fields are in a datetime format for time-based analysis.

Step 3: Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
	•	Calculate the following metrics:
	•	Number of Donations: Total number of successful solicitations.
	•	Dollar Value of Donations: Sum of donation amounts for successful solicitations.
	•	Legacy Donors and New Donors: Count of each donor type (legacy vs. new).
	•	Solicitation Success Rate: Percentage of solicitations resulting in donations.
	•	Comparisons:
	•	By Development Officer: Split KPIs by each officer.
	•	By Mode of Contact: Split KPIs by each mode (telephone, email, personal meeting).
	•	By Time: Aggregate KPIs by month and date.

Step 4: Choose Visualization Types
	•	High-Level KPIs: Display as summary cards or tiles (e.g., total donations, total dollar value).
	•	Comparisons:
	•	Bar charts or stacked bar charts for development officer and mode of contact.
	•	Time series line charts for monthly trends in donations and solicitations.
	•	Success Rate: Use pie charts or bar charts.
	•	Drill-Down Functionality:
	•	Filters for development officer, mode of contact, and date.

Step 5: Create the Dashboard
	1.	Tools: Use Python with Dash by Plotly for a dynamic and interactive dashboard.
	2.	Layout:
	•	Header with the title and brief description.
	•	KPI section displaying key metrics.
	•	Visualizations for comparisons (bar charts, time series).
	•	Filters for drill-down.
	3.	Styling:
	•	Use a professional color scheme (e.g., blue and gray tones).
	•	Add spacing and padding for clarity.
	•	Use consistent fonts and sizes for readability.

Step 6: Implement the Dashboard

Load and Prepare Data

import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
file_path = '/mnt/data/ProspectData.xlsx - Data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Preview the dataset
print(data.head())

# Convert date fields to datetime format
data['Solicitation Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Solicitation Date'])

Define KPIs

# Total donations
total_donations = data['Donation Amount'].sum()

# Number of donations
num_donations = data[data['Donation Result'] == 'Yes'].shape[0]

# Number of legacy donors and new donors
legacy_donors = data[data['Legacy Donor'] == 'Yes'].shape[0]
new_donors = data[data['Legacy Donor'] == 'No'].shape[0]

# Success rate
success_rate = num_donations / data.shape[0] * 100

Create Visualizations

import plotly.express as px

# Donations by development officer
officer_donations = data.groupby('Development Officer')['Donation Amount'].sum().reset_index()
fig_officer_donations = px.bar(
    officer_donations, x='Development Officer', y='Donation Amount',
    title='Donations by Development Officer', labels={'Donation Amount': 'Total Donations'}
)

# Success rate by mode of contact
contact_success = data.groupby('Mode of Contact')['Donation Result'].value_counts(normalize=True).unstack()
fig_contact_success = px.bar(
    contact_success, barmode='group', title='Success Rate by Mode of Contact',
    labels={'value': 'Success Rate', 'Mode of Contact': 'Contact Mode'}
)

# Monthly donations trend
monthly_donations = data.groupby(data['Solicitation Date'].dt.month)['Donation Amount'].sum().reset_index()
fig_monthly_donations = px.line(
    monthly_donations, x='Solicitation Date', y='Donation Amount',
    title='Monthly Donations Trend', labels={'Donation Amount': 'Total Donations'}
)

Build the Dashboard

from dash import Dash, dcc, html

# Initialize Dash app
app = Dash(__name__)
app.title = "ARF Donor Data Dashboard"

# Layout
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.H1("ARF Donor Data Dashboard", style={'textAlign': 'center'}),
    
    # KPI Section
    html.Div([
        html.Div(f"Total Donations: ${total_donations:,.2f}", className="kpi"),
        html.Div(f"Number of Donations: {num_donations}", className="kpi"),
        html.Div(f"Legacy Donors: {legacy_donors}", className="kpi"),
        html.Div(f"New Donors: {new_donors}", className="kpi"),
        html.Div(f"Success Rate: {success_rate:.2f}%", className="kpi"),
    ], className="kpi-container"),

    # Visualizations
    dcc.Graph(figure=fig_officer_donations),
    dcc.Graph(figure=fig_contact_success),
    dcc.Graph(figure=fig_monthly_donations),
])

Step 7: Test and Refine
	•	Test interactivity and responsiveness.
	•	Ensure filters work as intended.
	•	Refine visuals based on feedback.
